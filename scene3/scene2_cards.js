       In a small clinic outside Bhopal, a faint heartbeat flickers on a screen. An expectant mother watches an AI-powered prenatal app translate data into reassurance, it reads in her language: Hindi.
Across India, women from Gurgaon to rural Haryana use digital tools to track pregnancies, detect illness, and consult doctors remotely. 

“This digital leap is improving outcomes for women who once had almost no access to timely care,” says Shivangi, a health worker. Yet she knows progress must be fair. “Bias still lingers in the code, where cardiology algorithms misread women’s hearts,” she explains. “Progress means nothing if the data forgets who we are.”

Healthcare AI needs training data that includes diverse populations of women and minorities whose bodies have been medical afterthoughts for too long. We need algorithms that recognise hormonal cycles, pain patterns, and maternal health needs. That stops dismissing symptoms as "probably stress."
Her dream is simple yet radical: a world where her daughter’s body and voice are design priorities, not afterthoughts.

A Google Women Engineers Scholar, she's built SatyaScan to fight misinformation and EduNavigator to mentor girls like her younger self. "Bias isn't a bug you patch later," she says, eyes fixed on her screen. "It's a foundational flaw."
Across the ocean in Portland, Ann Marie uses AI for art and storytelling, but her patience is wearing thin. "Stop building AI we never asked for," she says. "Actually, ask what our needs are."
From Manila to Mumbai, from coding labs to rural clinics, women aren't waiting for permission anymore.
Because inclusion isn't a feature to be added later. It's the foundational code that everything else is built on. And we're rewriting it whether you're ready or not.

      For decades, conditions like endometriosis and uterine fibroids were medical afterthoughts. Mental health and reproductive care? Even further behind. Women's pain was dismissed, their cycles ignored, and their maternal needs sidelined.
But technology is beginning to listen.
Across India and Pakistan, AI-powered healthcare apps now offer virtual checkups, pregnancy guidance, and early disease detection, bridging gaps that geography and bias created. In rural villages, a woman's body speaks a language healthcare has never learned to hear.
"Most women in rural Pakistan don't have internet access," says Neel, a 32-year-old student. "Period trackers, location sharing, telehealth—these aren't luxuries. They're safety nets we've never had."
Natasha and Angelica, health advocates, dream bigger: AI that recognises hormonal cycles, understands maternal health patterns, and stops dismissing symptoms as "probably stress." Healthcare designed by women, for women—not as an afterthought, but as the foundation.
The WHO calls it digital health equity. Women call it long overdue.
The question isn't whether AI can transform women's healthcare. It's whether we'll finally let women design the algorithms that understand their bodies—or keep building systems that were never meant to see them clearly.

      One young woman summarised it perfectly: “Women in my family think 'AI' means robots or magic. But I’ve seen the pattern: first fear, then curiosity, then confidence.” - Meron, Ethiopia 

Every story has a beginning, and here, it often starts with fear of the mysterious buttons. Women in homes across India and neighbours across the region treated smartphones like ticking bombs. Shivangi, a girl from India shared: “My grandmother believed if she pressed the wrong button, the 'machine' would call Modi directly. So, she kept her distance…”


For weeks, the phone sat on the table like a museum piece. It was cleaned, admired, charged, but never touched. And then came the magic moment, the moment technology stopped being foreign and became personal. Someone casually mentioned, “You know, YouTube can show bhajans whenever you want.” Instant transformation. Fear evaporated. Curiosity took over. Within days, the same grandmother became, Shivangi  proudly said, “The streaming queen.”


She started subscribing to channels and adjusting video quality. The woman who once hid from the phone was now teaching others how to use it. 


It turns out, new technology isn’t intimidating when it speaks the language of daily life. When it helps with recipes, bills, devotion, children’s homework, or simply staying connected, mothers learn tech faster than anyone expects.

One young woman summarised it perfectly: “Women in my family think 'AI' means robots or magic. But I’ve seen the pattern: first fear, then curiosity, then confidence.” - Meron, Ethiopia 


And honestly, there’s something beautiful and hilarious about it. The same grandmother who once refused to swipe the screen now knows how to search recipes, listen to devotional songs, and send voice notes to relatives.
Not slow. Not hesitant. Just… streaming queen.

       In post-conflict Kurdistan, Iraq, technology became something unexpectedو and a rebuilding tool that opened doors faster than physical infrastructure could. A 26-year-old youth activist there watched digital education do what traditional systems couldn't: give women immediate access to skills, markets, and voices beyond borders.

“AI could help women access training in digital skills, entrepreneurship, and remote work, especially in areas where opportunities are limited.” - Resa, Kurdistan

In Kurdistan, women didn't wait for perfect conditions. They used what was available, smartphones, online platforms, to create pathways that geography and recent history tried to limit.
This pattern echoes across communities rebuilding in different ways. In Ethiopia, women navigate similar transitions. In rural India and Pakistan, different barriers create a similar hunger for access.

But something shifts when a girl in Punjab can learn the same coding course as someone in Silicon Valley. When an Ethiopian woman accesses the same business training as her urban counterpart. When a Pakistani teenager finds the same resources, regardless of the men around her controlling physical access. When a woman in Kurdistan can mentor or learn from someone continent.


Digital platforms don't erase inequality; infrastructure gaps persist. But they create possibilities that weren't there before. For women in communities rebuilding or breaking through traditional limitations, technology is transformational.
Geography used to be destiny. Now it's just a starting point.

      For Ann Marie, the spark didn’t come from a gadget or an app, but from a person. Her earliest memory of technology is of a woman at the front of a classroom - teaching computers with confidence and warmth. “We assumed she was an expert simply because she was a woman teaching computers,” Ann Marie laughs. But that assumption planted something deep in her: the idea that visibility matters.
Years later, Ann Marie works in AI design and ethics. She builds tools meant to empower, not exploit. “AI can do amazing things,” she says, “but if empathy isn’t part of the process, we end up with innovation that excludes the very people it should serve.” She often thinks of that teacher - standing before a room of unsure students, turning hesitation into hope. It reminds her that technology doesn’t just need intelligence; it needs heart. The woman who once taught her to press “save” taught her something far greater - that progress must never come at the cost of compassion.

       'story': `Every morning in a small school in Tamil Nadu, Meera chalks out lesson plans on the blackboard. But her classroom buzzes with anticipation right after she opens her laptop, and her ten students gather around. Their new helper is an AI assistant: it translates instructions, suggests personalised quizzes, and nudges shy pupils to engage. “At first, I was sceptical,” Meera recalls. “Would this machine know my students better than I do?”
Weeks pass, and change emerges. Group discussion grows, students show confidence answering questions, and they eagerly try the new digital reading exercises. Little Ananya, once silent at the back, now answers aloud, sometimes even correcting Meera’s Tamil translations. “Technology didn’t replace me,” Meera smiles, “it made me more attentive to what matters.”
The local Ministry reports hybrid classrooms with teacher-led AI tools raised comprehension by almost 40%. Peer teachers in the research group describe similar outcomes where rural girls who struggled with spelling suddenly mastered vocabulary; shy children excelled at quizzes generated just for them.
Still, Meera warns, “AI doesn’t see everything- a teacher knows when a child’s silence means more than a missed answer.” Community chats reveal hopes: that training continues, that local languages are supported, and that new tools honour empathy, not just automation.`},

  'story': `“If AI can predict climate change, then AI companies should also be accountable for worsening it.”
In a small town near Hyderabad, the power flickers again. My dad, a local internet café owner, laughs softly.. “Maybe the data centres are eating all our electricity.” It’s meant as a joke, but he’s not far off. On the city’s outskirts, new server farms hum night and day, cooling thousands of GPUs running AI models that most of the town’s residents will never use. While the machines learn, the river runs a little warmer, cooling water is discharged from unregulated facilities, and electricity bills rise for everyone else.“We thought technology was light,” our neighbour says. “But it’s heavy: on our air, our water, our power.” https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-runs-dirty-power-and-the-public-pays-the-price-2025-6
I can see a growing unease: AI promises efficiency, but hides its footprint. Training large models demands massive energy and water resources, often in regions already facing power shortages or drought. Yet there is no clear governance for measuring or mitigating these impacts.
Energy strain & emissions: A single advanced AI model can emit up to 300-500 tons of CO₂ during training, comparable to five cars running over their lifetime. (University of Massachusetts Amherst, 2023)


Water usage: Cooling systems for data centres consume millions of litres daily. Microsoft disclosed that its global water use rose 34% in one year, largely due to AI infrastructure growth (Reuters, 2024).
From India to Zambia, participants demand transparency and accountability from the AI industry and its enablers: Mandatory Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for AI data centres and cloud facilities, Carbon labelling for major AI products and models, like nutritional labels for emissions, Community inclusion in decision-making before large data facilities are established near towns or ecologically sensitive areas. `},

My techie brother explains well, “Your output images can be very well reverse engineered, especially when there is  a dire need for real raw data in this era of training-data scarcity!”
While AI promises creativity and convenience, its hunger for data has turned the internet into an unregulated training ground- absorbing faces, bodies, art, voices, and personal photos. Reverse-engineering technologies now allow reconstruction of identifiable faces from low-resolution images and even from blurred or pixelated datasets.. a process documented in recent studies by Stanford (2024) and MIT CSAIL (2023). These tools, meant for restoration or security, are increasingly weaponised for stalking, doxxing, and impersonation.`},

  'story': `"I Never Thought I'd Use the Internet. Now I'm Teaching Others."
In Saharanpur's women's center, Meena's fingers hover nervously over a donated tablet. Six months ago, she'd never touched the internet. Today, she logs in every evening to attend Hindi-language classes that are reshaping her world.
Across the room, her friend Shabnam grins proudly. "I sell my hand-embroidered dupattas to women in other towns now—all through WhatsApp!" she laughs. "I even taught my neighbors how to receive payments safely."
But their stories aren't just about individual triumph. They expose critical gaps in India's digital revolution.
"Some days, the network disappears during class," Shabnam sighs. Meena adds, "Banking websites are full of English words we don't understand. And women with disabilities can't even reach our center."
Their voices are being heard. Platforms like SWAYAM and DIKSHA now offer courses in regional languages. Campaigns like Yashoda AI are training lakhs of women in digital literacy. Young fintech engineers like Aarav are partnering with banks to design simpler, safer interfaces for women entrepreneurs.
As sunset paints Saharanpur gold, Meena taps her screen with newfound confidence. "Earlier, I didn't believe I could learn this," she says quietly. "Now I'm teaching others."
She pauses, then looks up. "My daughter will grow up knowing she can do business, study, and manage money—just like anyone, anywhere."
The question for policymakers isn't whether technology can empower women. It's whether we'll design it to.

  'story': `"She Thought One Wrong Click Would Call the Prime Minister. Now She Can't Stop Streaming."
My grandmother was terrified of computers. She genuinely believed if she pressed the wrong button, she'd accidentally call the Prime Minister or break something important. So she avoided them for years.
Then someone showed her YouTube. Specifically, bhajans. Endless devotional songs from her favorite singers.
Everything changed.
"I never thought I could find peace through this jadui dibba," she laughs now, calling her laptop the magical box. "It feels like prayers travel through it." For her, technology was never about innovation or algorithms. It was about connection.
She's not alone. Across India, women are quietly rewriting what technology means to them.
Shila, a weaver from Odisha, remembers her first smartphone. The buttons felt strange. Her neighbors laughed when she struggled to send a message. But local workshops taught her in Odia, NGOs gave free data, and her daughter patiently guided her through apps.
Now? She posts her handwoven saris on Instagram. Her first online order made her eyes light up like a child's.
Razia from Bihar learned UPI payments for groceries, joined WhatsApp groups with other artisans, then started selling her embroidery. "At first I just watched," she says. "Then I shared my work. People started calling to buy."
These women who once felt technology wasn't for them are now creators, businesswomen, digital safety advisors. Razia warns others about online scams in village group chats. Shila hosts live sessions teaching weaving techniques to people she'll never meet.
They've built something beautiful: trust and solidarity in digital spaces where they feel seen, heard, valued.
But the statistics tell a harder truth. Globally, women hold just 14% of tech leadership roles. Fifty percent quit by age 35, burned out, discriminated against, passed over for growth.
"We want online spaces where we can be ourselves," Shila says. "Safe from harassment. Where our voices matter."
Razia adds, "Technology should help us trust, bond, and grow together. Not just survive, but truly thrive."
The women building technology's future aren't asking for permission anymore. They're asking why the industry still isn't built for them to stay.

  'story': `Every day, millions of women lose hours to unpaid care work worth 8% of India's GDP. Nobody's paying them. Nobody's counting it. And nobody's helping them build wealth from what they create.
This is where AI can be leveraged.
When Hitaeshi's mother taught herself Zoom during lockdown, it wasn't curiosity. It was reclaiming time. When Nilancy's mother learned online payments, it was about control over her own money. Time poverty keeps 53% of Indian women out of formal work. They're not lacking ambition. They're lacking hours to build financial independence.
AI could change this. Not as another tool, but as the time equalizer women desperately need. Automating household tasks. Reclaiming hours lost to care work. Creating space for women to earn, save, and grow wealth.
Mazyopa's mother runs her business from a Nokia. Nilancy's community sells handmade goods on social media, building digital independence one transaction at a time. They're creating income streams, managing customers, building micro-enterprises with creativity and grit.
But financial systems don't recognize their work. No formal documentation. Language barriers. Banking apps in English. Payment systems that intimidate rather than empower.
AI could be their financial co-founder. Teaching money management in their language. Helping them track income and savings. Building confidence in digital payments. Turning side hustles into sustainable wealth.
The question isn't whether AI can empower women financially. It's whether we'll build it before another generation earns money they never learn to keep.

  'story': `In Ethiopia, Meron works at the intersection of technology, gender, and policy. Her definition of entrepreneurship is simple: “It’s rewriting systems that were never built for us.” She’s seen women use online platforms to start businesses, find independence, and connect globally. Yet, she also sees the barriers — limited access, digital harassment, and funding gaps that silence women’s ideas before they start.
“If we don’t participate in shaping AI,” she warns, “we risk being shaped by it.” Her advocacy focuses on ensuring women are not just users of technology but co-authors of its future. She works with governments and startups to bring inclusion into every layer of AI design - from data collection to deployment.
For Meron, success isn’t measured in profit or patents. It’s measured in voices. Every woman who learns, leads, or builds because of her efforts is a data point of progress - proof that systems can be reprogrammed, not just run.

  'story': `“I never set out to be an entrepreneur,” Sarah says. “I just kept finding problems no one else wanted to solve.” Her first project was a simple payment system for small vendors who couldn’t afford complex tools. It wasn’t glamorous, but it worked and it mattered.
Sarah had watched too many people shut out of technology because they believed it wasn’t “for them.” “When women say, ‘I’m not a tech person,’ I ask, who made you believe that?” she says. Her approach to entrepreneurship is rooted in empathy: identify what’s broken, then build something useful enough to heal it.
She often imagines AI as a mentor rather than a machine, a quiet voice reminding people they belong in spaces once closed to them. Her story is not about disruption or ambition; it’s about care. Sarah doesn’t just design software; she designs access. For her, entrepreneurship is not invention for profit, it’s creation for connection.

  'story': `When you step in, the light feels different. It flickers above us, but what shines is within each of us, says Miriam, a young mother from Lusaka. On Sunday evenings, women gather beneath a single roof, some just learning to type, others showing nervous laughter before pressing a key. They call themselves The Circle of Light.
“For me, using a laptop was always something only teachers or big officials did. Now, I can send pictures of what I make—bracelets, mats—to other women in the group. They teach me, I teach them. Sometimes we forget who’s the student and who’s the teacher.”
In a region where only one in four women has steady internet, the act of learning basic digital skills is revolutionary. Miriam and her peers have begun forming WhatsApp groups to sell crafts, draft messages, and upload photos. The small triumphs add up—a new sale, a message typed without hesitation.
“As we learn together, the fear goes.” The settlement echoes with laughter and the beeping of keys. “This computer,” she says, “is not just a box—it’s a mirror. We see what we might become.”
Government programs like India’s PMGDISHA and the Smart Village Initiative in Zambia are bringing digital tools to women at local levels, but Miriam believes the real change comes from within communities. “You have to trust us to lead. These gatherings are the start of something big, if only others would listen.”
Her hope is shared: that officials and organisations see small digital circles not just as learners, but as leaders—pioneers of digital democracy, where every woman grows strong and helps others do the same.

  'story': `Afiwa Mensah rises before sunrise in her village in northern Ghana. Every evening, as the sky dims and the heat fades, she gathers with her daughter and neighbours beneath an old acacia tree. The sound of children’s laughter mixes with the quiet tap of solar-powered tablets waking up to life. Before, seasons were ruled by guessing at the sky, by the wisdom passed down in stories and long meetings.
The first time Afiwa touched the weather mapping app, her hands shook. She worried she’d break something. But her daughter grinned, showed her how to swipe, how to open the rainfall map. “Now, the land talks to me through data,” Afiwa says. The meetings under the tree transformed. “We plan together: planting, how much water, sharing updates by message with women in other villages. Some nights, even my mother—who never learned to read—sends voice notes to her sisters. The children listen, sometimes helping with the buttons.”
Harvests grew steadier. Losses from droughts became rare. Everyone in the group has a story—the neighbour who saved her yams after a surprise storm, the grandmother who now tells stories while sending messages on her tablet. “We aren’t alone with technology. We use old stories and new screens together,” Afiwa smiles. “People help each other with both.”
It’s more than farming; it’s survival and solidarity. Community rituals mixed with something new—a confidence that tomorrow can be planned, not just prayed for. “Digital connection is our seed, and community is our rain,” Afiwa says.
Their wish is clear: “Let governments and organizations come listen to us before they drop off devices and leave. We want training, apps that speak our languages, tools that fit our real lives.” In this village, the future of agriculture is as much about heart and togetherness as about data and screens.

  'story': `“When women build the systems, technology listens better,” says Sarah Forrest, an AI advisor and computer science graduate student from Massachusetts. Her earliest tech memories are shaped by helping her grandmother with college assignments at age 50 and teaching herself to troubleshoot family finances. “Technology became my entry point to a wider world—a way to connect beyond what we could see.”
Sarah spends evenings running community workshops for women and caregivers, where the aim is not just to teach code, but to build digital confidence. “Bias isn’t a bug—it’s who’s not in the room. When women, people from marginalised backgrounds, or those with caregiving roles co-design digital safety and privacy, the whole system shifts.”
Across stories in your research, women echo this: empathy is as essential as intelligence. “I want AI to act as a bridge, not a barrier—detecting harassment, amplifying unheard stories, and ensuring everyone can find mentorship, care, and opportunity,” writes Kangkana Barman from Assam. OECD findings show that diverse design teams reduce AI bias by 25% and drive greater user trust. “True innovation isn’t just efficiency—it’s belonging, rooted in care,” Sarah adds.
Sarah’s hope: “The next generation of AI must remember what makes us human. Our belonging starts with who holds a seat at the table. That’s what transforms technology from a tool into an ally.”

  'story': `Kimberly’s story begins in the soft hum of a library computer lab, long before Wi-Fi was everywhere. “I used to spend hours printing pages to take home,” she says. Her grandmother, who started college at fifty, would wait patiently beside her, asking how to type her name. Those evenings were full of laughter and learning, two generations discovering technology together.
For Kimberly, that space became her first classroom in self-reliance. As a first-generation college student, she soon found herself fixing neighbours’ laptops, teaching others how to send emails, and setting up online accounts for those who feared “breaking the internet.” These small acts were more than technical help - they were steps toward empowerment.
Now, Kimberly teaches AI literacy to women in underserved communities. To her, entrepreneurship isn’t just about creating businesses; it’s about creating access. It’s about using what you know to lift others higher. The same girl who once helped her grandmother type essays now helps others find their digital voice. What started as love became a legacy.

  'story': `She remembers the first time her mother spoke to a phone — not to someone on the other end, but to the device itself.

 “Show me pictures,” her mother said, and the phone obeyed. It was a quiet moment, but something shifted. A woman who once waited for help to search or scroll suddenly realised she could ask, and the world would answer back.
Years later, her daughter is studying computer science, designing the very systems that now listen to millions of voices. For her, technology isn’t just convenience, it’s confidence made visible.

She sees how AI gives women in her community access to education, safety, and independence, but she also feels the shadows of privacy breaches and deepfakes.
Still, her vision is tender and fierce: AI that “assists like a friend,” that motivates, listens, and gives comfort. A world where no one is divided by wealth or class, where compassion sits at the core of every algorithm.
 When she codes, she remembers that first voice command, the courage it took to ask a question out lou,d and she builds for that same courage in others.
